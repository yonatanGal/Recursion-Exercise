=============================
=  README for ex7: Recursion  =
=============================

==================
=  Description:  =
==================

in this exercise we practiced the use of recursion in programming.
we wrote the following functions:

1. print_to_n(n): this function prints all positive integers up to n.

2. print_reversed(n): this function prints all positive integers, from n
   to 1.

3. is_prime(n): this function checks if a given number n is a prime number.
   i used an inner function called has_divisor_smaller_than(n, i), which
   checks recursively if n has any divisor, smaller than i.

4. exp_n_x(n, x): this function receives a natural number n and a float number
   x and returns the sum of the function exp powered by x. i used an auxiliary
   function which calculates the factorial of n for it.

5. play_hanoi(hanoi, n, src, dest, temp): this function solves the famous
   riddle of the hanoi towers.

6. print_sequences(char_list, n): this function receives a list of chars and a
   positive number n and prints every possible sequence that we can create based
   with the chars on the list, and we can use every char as many times as we
   want. (as long as it's not over n times, of course). i used an auxiliary
   function which creates every possible sequence in a recursive way.

7. print_no_repetition_sequences(char_list, n): same as the previous function,
   but this time each char can appear in the sequence only one time,
   so basically, we print all the permutations of the char_list.

8. parentheses(n, valid_option="", open_bracket=0): this function receives a
   positive integer n, and returns every legal sequence of parentheses.

9. up_and_right(n, k, combination=''): this function receives positive numbers
   n and k, which represent 'x' and 'y' positions in a Coordinate system, and
   returns every possible way of getting to this position.

10. flood_fill(image, start): this function receives a matrix (image) and a
    position in the matrix (start), and based on them change the matrix.
